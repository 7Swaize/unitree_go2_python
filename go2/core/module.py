class DogModule(ABC):
    """
    Base class for all dog functionality modules.

    This class defines the common lifecycle shared by all internal modules (e.g., movement, video, etc.).
    Modules are not meant to be interacted with or instaniated directly. Users should only interact with initialized modules 
    via :class:`~core.controller.Go2Controller`.

    Notes
    -----
    - All modules must implement ``initialize`` and ``shutdown``.
    - Initialization is idempotent and guarded by ``_initialized``.
    - Modules are created and managed by the module registry.
